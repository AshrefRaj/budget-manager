Just a Simple Front-end only Budget app made as a part of my React Learning.

Utilises client's LocalStorage to store budget & Expense data.
Uses react-bootstrap and uuid for css and unique ID generation respectively.

To Set up React Dev server with nodemon:

    It's a pretty straight forward process, which is generally used to start apps created using create-react-app
    Clone the repo, and run "npm ci" inside the repo.
    Run "npm start" to start dev server.
